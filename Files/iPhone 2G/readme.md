<p><b>Files for iPhone 2G</b></p>

The first generation iPhone, also known as iPhone 2G is compatible with both iDroid and OpeniBoot, therefore, you can use this project on the original iPhone.

The files are pre-compiled (to avoid the old and by now no longer working compiling tutorial), the version of OpeniBoot is 0.2 and the version of the Android (iDroid) is 2.6!

<p><B>The files have been tested prior to being uploaded and they worked for iPhone 2G 8 GB</b></p>
