<p><b>Files for iPhone 3G</b></p>

The first generation iPhone, also known as iPhone 3G is compatible with both iDroid and OpeniBoot, therefore, you can use this project on the original iPhone.

The files are pre-compiled (to avoid the old and by now no longer working compiling tutorial), the version of OpeniBoot is 0.2 and the version of the iDroid version is PepperKaka 11.02, which I think it is the last one made.
